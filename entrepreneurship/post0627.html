                        Our existence involves interaction with the environment around us. But unavoidably, we end up being so involved in living that we become unconscious of our activities, and the objects that we are involved with. We reluctantly wake up in the morning, turn on the tap, and there is purified water. We switch on the geezer and in a while, we get hot water. We go to the kitchen, open the relevant cabinet and get processed bread; open the refrigerator and we have butter and eggs. We sit in our car and drive to work. Similarly, we perform our daily activities and for the lot of us, at least, our requirements are readily available for us. But if we take a step back and contemplate, I think we can appreciate the beauty of civilization. The water that is readily available for us had to be purified by the different methods of purification and it had to be delivered to our taps through pipelines, which had to be installed. The same goes for the car we use, the clothes we wear, the gadgets we buy, the food we eat, etc. Everything necessary is readily available for us unless we are working in a place which involves catering to one or some of the needs of the society; and incidentally, this is something we all do.  It is our 'job'. In this case, we are the once providing to satisfy the requirement.

                        Now, one of the reasons why we are successful in this venture of efficiently running the society is primarily because of our human instinct of co-operation. There is another technical question to be asked here- what runs the economy of society?  Is it the working class people? or is it the companies that these employees work for? Although both these answers are true, a further abstraction will reveal to us, Industries. Every company can be categorized as belonging to a certain Industry. For example, Airtel, Vodaphone, Jio, etc. belong to the telecom and communication Industry. Industries run the economic wheel of civilization. So here is a list of the top biggest  Industries in the world. The following ranking is based on common sense reinforced with analyzed statistical data.

                        1) Real estate:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The total worth of land comes under real estate. In early 2016, the Savills World Research team reported that global real estate values totaled $217 trillion. Savills research for 2017 shows that figure has risen. Global asset price inflation has increased the amount to $228 trillion at constant prices, an increase of 5 percent in real terms. Global real estate is a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitized debt combined — which, together with amounts to just $170 trillion. The value of all the gold ever mined throughout history pales into even greater insignificance at a mere $6.5 trillion.

                        The food industry is a complex, global collective of diverse businesses that supplies most of the food consumed by the world's population. It includes agriculture, livestock, seafood, food processing, marketing, retail, distribution, etc. People love to eat food; and for the people who don't love it, well, they eat it for nourishment nonetheless. Therefore, the food industry is one of the biggest industries in the world. The global food and agricultural industry for 2018 totaled about $8.7 trillion, according to Plunkett Research estimates, or about 10% of the world's GDP.  Global food exports totaled $1.47 trillion in 2017, according to the World Trade Organization (latest data available).  One research by satista shows a Revenue in the Food & Beverages segment amounts to US$108,402m in 2019. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2019-2023) of 10.1%, resulting in a market volume of US$159,100m by 2023.

According to market research by IBISWorld, a leading business intelligence firm, the total revenues for the oil and gas drilling sector came to $2 trillion in 2017. Since the 2017 estimates for worldwide gross domestic product range between $75 trillion and $87.5 trillion, the oil and gas drilling sector currently make up something between 2% and 3% of the global economy.
