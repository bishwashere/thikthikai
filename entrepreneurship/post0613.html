                        The Greek philosopher Aristotle once defined a human being as a “Rational animal”. Reason, according to Aristotle was that one thing that separated Humans from animals. But I suppose, today he would think otherwise; primarily because of the contemporary preoccupation of humans with a materialistic lifestyle. These days, our identity is predicated on the things we own and our capacity to buy more things; we are as of now-Consumers.

                        Consumerism involves- shopping, buying and consuming. The first two is facilitated by the sellers through marketing strategies like advertising and by the elegant presentation of the product at retail. The effectiveness of these marketing strategies depends on the immanent psychology of the consumer and the motivation that drives a consumer to buy things. It is important to note that consumerism does necessarily involve shopping; shopping as in, appraising a desired product in multiple shops and this particular activity has nothing to do with actually buying the product but with the imagined pleasure of having it. This is the reason why people window shop.

                        Now, there are different types of consumers mentalities: people who are ready to spend lavishly, people who consider the quality and utility of the product and the people who go for quality-things only if it’s for free. All these three types apply across the board to online-consumers as well.

                        In modern times there has been a revolution in the manner in which products are sold. The era of high-speed internet has paved the way for a different brand of retail, which involves online shopping for clothes, like amazon or myntra etc., software as a service provider (SaaS) like Spotify, Netflix, phone pe etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Lets talk SaaS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coming to the marketing involved SaaS products, it has been studied that there is considerable difference involved in selling SaaS products to the masses. One study found that- “SaaS vendors should use defensive strategies in the early phases of the solution life cycle, and measure all marketing campaigns, especially with regard to the cost per customer acquisition.  It is essential for SaaS vendors to address trust issues and to provide technical and security-related information. It is also important to inform customers about benefits of using the SaaS solution versus on-premise software by providing information on how easy it is to configure the solution, and the available online training and support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, free trials or demonstrations should be offered. In marketing of SaaS solutions, social media (together with blogs and forums), Word of Mouth, and even personalized email campaigns should be the initial strategies used by the marketer. This research also found that both direct (mostly through the Internet) and indirect (through representatives and partners) channels are used by the SaaS providers to communicate with customers”. There are also certain pros and cons involved in subscription-based apps.
                    <p>
                        The Pros: they tend to have higher revenue than any other business models, they offer reliable income, they result in more engaged audience. The most adversely affective con would be a transition from free to payment. Also, not all SaaS products with subscription has been observed to be a success. Recurring subscription for more and better content is a tried and tested successful business model. Single purpose apps or software, which involve subscriptions, like an alarm clock or dictionary hasn’t been able to gather much success.
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>It is essential for SaaS vendors to address trust issues and to provide technical and security-related information.

                        Marketing uses several techniques to unconsciously persuade the consumer to buy their product. Therefore, the consumer is usually under the impression that more is better and high prize means good quality; although, in reality this may not be a necessary co-relation. Regardless, there are many SaaS products that are actually worth the money. The first one that comes to mind is Amazon prime. The subscription offers guaranteed fast and free deliveries on most of the products listed on the e-commerce platform. Prime membership also gives exclusive deals and early access to members on Lightning Deals as well. The package also includes prime video; which gives a variety of viewing options from different genres, different languages. This includes movies, documentaries, Tv-series etc. and prime music. All this for 999 per year in India. One other SaaS product is- Spotify. Spotify premium offers uninterrupted, ad free, offline playback for just Rs.13 per day, Rs. 119 per month (recurring) and Rs. 1,189 per year. One other SaaS product is Paytm First. Paytm First offers benefits worth Rs. 12,000, which include: Zomato gold membership for 3 months, Annual Sony Liv subscription, ViU Premium, Uber benefits up to Rs. 6000, Rs. 100 cash back on movies each month, Exclusive offers on Paytm Mall, Priority shipping and Priority 24*7 customer care support.

                        Finally, one thing we can learn from the above that, although we are consumers, we can be mindful and choose wisely. This article is written so that both the buyer and the seller understand each other better.
