                        Every living thing eats food. Food is the fuel that our bodies require to function. The nutrients in the food we eat and liquids we drink are broken down into simpler compounds. Proteins are converted into amino acids, fats are converted into glycerol and the carbohydrates into sugars[1]. If your sugar consumption exceeds your body's immediate energy needs, glucose converts to glycogen and becomes stored in your liver and muscles. Once these organs reach their capacity to store glycogen, excess glucose first converts to fatty acids and then to triglycerides, which become stored in your adipose tissue, to be used in times of lack of energy in the body. Now,  the food we eat and the liquids we drink affects our whole body; which includes the brain. Therefore, it won't be surprising to know that our habitual consumption of certain foods and liquids i.e., our diet, affects our brain and in turn our mental health too.  This knowledge is giving rise to a concept called "nutritional (or food) psychiatry"[2].

                    <p>
                        But, how exactly does our diet affect our mental health? Here, I will explore three possibilities- The food-mood relation, the connection between a bad diet and mental disorders, and The benefits of certain nutrients for mental health.

                        <h3>The food-mood relation:</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of us have experienced this phenomenon where we resort to eating sugary foods to make us feel better. If you haven't experienced it, you might have watched a post-breakup scene in some Hollywood Romedy movie, where the girl/the guy cries on the couch, while eating a bowl of ice cream, watching a romantic movie with a happy ending. In India, there is a belief that spicy food, ginger, and garlic increases the sex drive. Although we won't look into the validity of such beliefs, we can at least ascertain that people intuitively feel like there is a link between the food we eat and our mood. The Harward blog of Health publishing, explains this link. "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep and appetite, mediate moods, and inhibit pain.  Since about 95% of your serotonin is produced in your gastrointestinal tract, and your gastrointestinal tract is lined with a hundred million nerve cells, or neurons, it makes sense that the inner workings of your digestive system don't just help you digest food, but also guide your emotions"[3]. So, here are some strategies to regulate your mood with your diet: Avoid eating sugars like candy, soda, and jam. These cause the blood sugar to spike and drop, thus can leave you with a short-lived burst of energy followed by a tired, cranky feeling. For best mood results, you should also limit alcohol, since it's a depressant and can disturb your sleep. Adding protein to your meals can help slow the absorption of carbohydrates in your blood and increase the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, which may improve your mood and energy for several hours after eating. Try eggs, fish, chicken low-fat greek yogourt. There are a few specific vitamins that may be helpful for mood. For example, vitamin D may help relieve mood disorders, such as seasonal affective disorder. Sunlight, before sunscreen application, is often the best source. To get your daily dose of vitamin D. To get your daily dose of vitamin D, you can also try the following foods: low-fat milk, egg yolk, soymilk. Vitamin folate and B-12 may help ease depression. To add folate in your diet, try broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, oranges, dark leafy green. Vitamin B-12 can be found in cottage cheese, lean beef, salmon. Soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar and thus increase serotonin. You can find healthy amounts of fibers in oats, beans, pears, peas.  Furthermore, according to research published by the University of Illinois Extension, eating regular meals and snacks at the same time every day helps keep your blood sugar levels steady and this may assist in keeping your mood stable [4].

                        <h3>The connection between a bad diet and mental disorders:</h3>
                    </p>
                    </p>
                        A lack of essential nutrients is known to contribute to the onset of poor mental health in people suffering from anxiety and depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ADHD [5].

                    <p>
                        It is now known that many mental health conditions are caused by inflammation in the brain which ultimately causes our brain cells to die. This inflammatory response starts in our gut and is associated with a lack of nutrients from our food such as magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamins and minerals that are all essential for the optimum functioning of our bodies [6]. Poor nutrition can lead to physical health problems such as obesity. Although the relationship between obesity and mental health problems is complex.  Results from a 2010 systematic review found two-way associations between depression and obesity, finding that people who were obese had a 55% increased risk of developing depression over time, whereas people experiencing depression had a 58% increased risk of becoming obese. There also seems to be a link between diet and depression. But conclusively linking your diet with your risk of depression is another story. It's not yet possible to identify a single nutritional factor that increases or decreases the risk of depression, says Chocano-Bedoya, a senior epidemiologist at the University of Zurich.

                        "There is limited evidence regarding the risk of depression associated with unhealthy dietary habits," she says[7]. One 2018 meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Nutrition suggested that high consumption of meat could be associated with the risk of developing depression [8].

                        <h3>The benefits of certain nutrients for mental health:</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a growing awareness - sadly insufficient - regarding mental health among people. Although many of the mental disorders are linked to genetics, upbringing, some trauma; as we have just uncovered, there are dietary links too. So, at least one way to have better mental health is by observing a good diet. Recent research has shown that food supplements such as zinc, magnesium, omega 3, and vitamins B and D3 can help improve people's mood, relieve anxiety and depression and improve the mental capacity of people with Alzheimer's [9]. Magnesium is one of the most important minerals for optimal health, yet many people are lacking in it. One study found that a daily magnesium citrate supplement led to a significant improvement in depression and anxiety, regardless of age, gender or severity of depression. Improvement did not continue when the supplement was stopped [10]. Omega-3 fatty acids are another nutrient that is critical for the development and function of the central nervous system - and a lack has been associated with low mood, cognitive decline, and poor comprehension [11]. Vitamin B complex and zinc are other supplements found to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression [12]. There is consistent evidence for a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern and a lower risk of depression [4].

                        <h3>The rainy season and Mental health  : 
                            </h3>

                        The hot summer has ended and the cold breeze of monsoon has arrived, bringing along with it the heavy droplights of rain which aim to greenify and cool the environment around. The greener and the coolness are not all that the monsoon brings; this is the season where people experience sickness as well. We have all experienced a change in our mood. Rain in the majority of cases will cause depressive feelings and/or thoughts to become more prevalent; hence the expression 'feeling blue'. Rain or snow can make the outdoors damp, cold, empty and at times unpleasant; particularly when it occurs for long periods of time. Not wanting to go outside can then lead to feeling isolated, segregated and dejected. Once a person with a mental health condition begins to experience this they can at times then escalate to feelings of claustrophobia, agoraphobia, frustration and/or anxiety [14]. However, it is not just the rain itself that causes this; it is also what the rain actually does.  Therefore it is vital to take in foods that strengthen our immune system. So, here are a few diet tips to alleviate our gloomy mood and maintain our mental health this rainy season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fruits rich in Vitamin C are adviced. Fruits like lemon, tangerines, grapefruit, lime help build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Red bell peppers:</b>  They contain Vitamin C and are also a rich source of beta carotene.  Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ginger:</b> May help decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a sore throat and other inflammatory illnesses. Ginger may also help decrease nausea [13].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Berries:</b> Blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries are all high in vitamin C, which helps cope with cortisol, a hormone that is released during times of stress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Beans:</b> Black beans, lentils, and lima beans are all rich in magnesium, a mineral that functions to provide relaxation and calm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dark Chocolate:</b> Chocolate is one of the ultimate comfort foods. The very taste of chocolate can produce a near euphoric state in many people. Brain healthy dark chocolate is full of protein and fiber and supports a positive mood and healthy cognition.
                    </p>
                    </p>
                        <b>Herbal Teas:</b> Many herbal teas, such as chamomile, have calming properties. Black, green, white and red (rooibos) teas are also rich in antioxidants. Drinking a cup of warm tea can relieve stress and lift the spirits [15].
                    </p>
                    </p>
                        A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies involving nearly 23,000 people found that for every three cups of tea (green or black) consumed per day, the risk of depression fell by 37 percent [16]. Even plain water can boost mood and ward off depression. A study of 120 healthy young women found that higher habitual water intake was associated with better moods. The women who drank the least water (about one and a half liters a day) had the highest scores on a test of mood disturbance, as well as a higher incidence of depression. On the other hand, the women who drank the most water (just over three liters a day) had the lowest mood disturbance scores, and also reported the least depression, tension, and confusion [17].
