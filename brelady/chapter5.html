                        <hr>

                    <p>
                        Snow and hail, oblique and cold, the trees not making a difference. His eyes were barely open and his blood barely warm. Dog couldn't have survived on this own, thought Brelady. Not when he was just around a month old. How did he come to be around here? And why is this his earliest memory? Snow piled on and on, and Dog wriggled and moved as much as he could, frantically looking around. His whimpers could be hardly heard amidst the gale and the rain, and his fur was dripping with water. It was a miracle that he survived this, but I cannot afford the time to find how, thought Brelady. Just as she was about to drain him more and fly forward, she heard a voice in the distance. Humans. Dog, his survival instinct kicking in ran, as far his shuffling quickly forward could be called running, towards the voice. There were two of them, far off in the distance, clothed in layers, fur boots as thick as his head. Relief ran through his tiny body as he looked up at them. The leaner one noticed him and her face wrinkled with concern. Dog collapsed, knowing he was in safe hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Dog woke up in a hut unlike any other Brelady had ever seen. It was filled with several scores of ropes of exotic herbs and more than a dozen pelts of strange looking animals. At the other end of the hut and to the corner laid several ropes of Uerbena, a rare stimulant that until then she had only seen in the form of individual leaves. Coca roots dangled from the sloped ceiling, most of them old to the point of dessication. A whole yak pelt was spread on the floor, and the two rescuers were even sitting on it. Brelady couldn't believe her eyes. She had never seen such decadence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "He doesn't look like a highland puppy, does he?", said the thinner of the two, a woman, her voice a cloak of warmth and worry. Her hair was short, barely down halfway her neck, and she was looking at Dog with a piercing gaze directly in contrast to her matronly tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        " Must be a half wolf mongrel. I wonder what happened to his mother." said the other, a veritable giant by the looks of him. " No matter. Strauss will tame him. I know.". He held a tightly wrapped bundle in his hand. A nose poked out of it, already slightly hawkish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brealdy drained The Dog some more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dog looked at his master as he gazed down the abyss. He seemed to be five or six years old. He was at the edge of Rihati now. His parents seemed to be nowhere around. She could hear him reciting the First law incessantly under his breath. She was still too early.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brelady drained him some more. He was strong, he could take it, she thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Five candles floated in the air of the hut, the hut that the present Strauss lived in, and they gave light to dozens of scrolls scattered over the floor. Dog was curled next to his teenage master hunched over and focused on a single one. Brelady could read the scrolls through Dog's eyes. They spoke of more potent strains of the disciplines that she was familiar with. The Heating Discipline was said to be a more energy draining and intense version of the Warming Discipline where the First Law was not followed thus allowing for magnification of the energy received from the source. The Farsight Discipline was called an "an inferior, diluted version" of the Wraith Discipline in which one can see right through objects if one so desires. There were dozens of these scrolls, each of which spoke of several disciplines capable of affecting and creating effects of wide control and distinction. Furthermore, very few of them seem to follow the Rules that she was told was integral to The White Gift. That could either mean that these disciplines were just some fictional scribblings of madmen or that there other sects of magic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brelady lost herself in the implications that those scrolls presented, and read each of them multiple times to get a complete understanding of their workings and their intentions. She wanted to figure out where these scrolls were obtained from since she had never seen them in the Source. She forgot herself. She forgot that she was in someone else's memory. She forgot that she herself was in the process of a casting and that she was using someone else as a source. Moreover, she forgot that because she was using someone else, she needs to complete her casting as quickly as possible since the source's exhaustion and depletion of energy was not felt by her. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brelady remembered what she was doing as the memories began to crumble. The candles flickered and the words on the scrolls merged together. The hut quaked with feverish ferocity and the walls began to crumble revealing an intense dark void surrounding them. Brelady cancelled her casting and jumped to get out of the memory. But the void pulled her back in. She tried again to get out, forcing herself to stay calm, simultaneously trying to recall anything that could help her get out. But her legs remained planted on the now gray floor of the hut, and the walls were no more, and the teenager Strauss was crouched over and sitting on nothing but a well of blackness of unending depth. Brelady could feel several appendages of the void going into her head through her ears, moistly squirming against her skin, clasping their suctions against her brain. Her legs were no longer hers and she felt herself collapse against what remained of the floor. Just as she slumped down the floor into the void, she hoped that Dog was okay. She deserved this but the Dog didn't. She hoped that she hadn't killed him.
