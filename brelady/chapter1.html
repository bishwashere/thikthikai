                        She was seven. Fortunate to be guided by her parents, she was protected. She would listen to them carefully. What they speak. What they mean. And most importantly, what they hide. All was known to Brelady. Her concentration was sharp and her focus was different that the children of her age. She was not the ordinary, cute, and playful child one would imagine a child to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the valley of white magic where roads shined in white glitters, where carriages appeared and disappeared along the way, where sound of things were broken and would be heard once in a while, where leaves disappeared before they reached the ground, where a soft background tune would always be playing, where blowing wind would carry good fragrance all the time, where people's face had only one particular expression; smile, Brelady felt alone. She had her parents with her, but she felt alone. More particularly, she felt there were secrets in the Moha valley that were calling to be reached at.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        She wanted to learn about things. She was very curious. She wanted to learn everything she heard, saw and imagined about. From ages, the teaching of Moha Valley were that of peace, hope, determination, courage and love. Brelady sensed early in her life that these teachings were biased. That feeling when you get a doubt about yourself while walking in the dark. The feeling of fear when someone shouted loudly at you. These had no explanation in the Moha Valley. The teaching she received from her parents, from her elders, from her saints, about peace, she knew, were not enough to understand everything around her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "This is only one part" Brelady often told herself. She was not one of those normal kids who were happy, jolly and merry in the world they saw around. Yes, she was happy but she had one thing that was not seen in the valley for centuries; curiosity, the desire to know more. Some said it was good, the truth tellers. Who do not always speak good told it is bad. "She should be exiled", some even heard them say. But in the surrounding of Moha Valley nothing; meaning nothing was allowed to be in doubt or surprize. The rules said; peace be kept, no matter the cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules of the Moha Valley were that of love, help, kindness, compassion and truthfulness. The first rule said: "Love heals". And thus when there were accidents, something broke down, with love it could be healed. The carriages that got cracks would be healed, the person with a cut would get healed, the marks on the walls, streets, would slowly vanish. All people did was show love, care for it; moved their hands around the wound with care. And it would heal. This was the first rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Before turning seven, Brelady would always accept all the rules and not question anything at all. Today she turned seven. On her birthday she seemed like she changed. Her curiosity that used to be kept inside of her itself started coming out in the form of words. These words were a thing of neglect to her elders. When she asked, "Love heals, then what destroys?" it was as if no question was asked, it would be like nobody heard anything and nobody would respond.
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                        In the Moha Valley, nothing was ever different, not after the incident that occurred 101 years ago. But now things were starting to change. What happened 101 years ago, some truth tellers felt was going to repeat. "If there is a choice, then there is doubt, otherwise everything is the truth", Brelady thought walking down the aisle, "All the rules of the valley", she sighed, "cannot be the entirety".
