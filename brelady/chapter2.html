                        Previous Chapter - <a href = "./chapter1.html">Chapter 1: She was Seven</a>
                        <hr>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aisle went down from the roundabout of the grand circle which was in the middle of the valley. It was the narrowest street of the village towards the West. On either side of the road was the building of "School of Arts" and "The huts of Saints". As Brelady was gong down the walking trails she observed the calm and ancient building at the end of the road. She had seen this building from her very childhood. Here questions were common and it was allowed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The building always stood there. It was the reason of the valley's strength. It was the proff of knowledge. It was the valley's history and tradition. It was where everyone in the valley learned magic. This  building was called  "The Source", and it really was the source of knowledge to the people of Mohaland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brelady neared the gate and pushed it open. She saw someone running towards her but the setting sunlight were working against her eye. As the doors opened the cranking sound of it was disturbed by Thomsa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Hey! Happy Birthday"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Oh! Thank you"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Did you heal that thing in your head?", exclaimed Thomsa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What thing?", asked Brelady.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That thing ..asking questions outside The Source ...imaginations...curiosity", making his tone more serious he told, "I heard the The Truth Tellers telling that that thing in your head is not good for anybody".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Truth tellers do not always speak truth", she exclaimed, "They modify truth to match the Valley's rules."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Reality that they think is real, but infact, isint. I don't believe them all the times. They invent things to support the Valley's tradition and always support the rules."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Yes! And rules keep us alive" said Thomsa looking somewhat disappointed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rule 2 said, "All rules are magic". When everyone knew what that meant it was a forever mystery to Brelady. She would think why Rule 2 isint Rule 1?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During class timing Thomsa came inside the hall leaving some friends he was talking to near the entrance. He was quiet the opposite of Brelady. Where Brelady was quite, thoughtful and introvert, Thomsa was loud speaking, follower of Rules, witty and extrovert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly saint Fairous announced, "The total five rules of our village, or so as to speak as we refer to them as magic here at The Source and as they infact are, have something more in them..."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly a loud noise filled the entire hall, "What? Five rules have more meaning?....See I told you....I knew something more was there...is it true?".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fairous exclaimed, "Yes. As you might have guessed, my dear students, the five rules, they can be paired in two."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What? How is this possible?...How come we didn't know about it....The elders knew and didn't tell us? Why?", these common curiosities filled the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Source had many curious minds; Brelady topped that list. When this happened Brelady was silent and observant. "You want to understand what this all means?" exclaimed Fairous, "That...is your assignment for this fall."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was a holiday season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As teacher Fairous vanished from the podium the room was already full of curious minds. Questions were common at The Source because teachers purposely made students think. It was a learning place. But today's noise suggested confusion seen like never before. Amidst all the crowd and the noise Thomsa noticed, Brelady was missing.
