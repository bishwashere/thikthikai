                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three score huts, a dozen stone archways, tens of intertwining roads carved onto the terrain, with an undertow of innumerable tendrils of isolation palpable and seemingly quietly celebrated, Rihati was the only major human settlement in the hundreds of league spanning Moha Valley. A town, mainly in a morphological sense, is built around nerves of trade and enterprise, and an image of the place as a hub for commercial exchanges is integral to its acceptance as a town. But a prerogative for such fiscal undergoings, is of course the acknowledgment and execution of a market based economic structure.  That required either money or a well defined system of bartering. The Mohacan Society had neither. Their economy was one based on gifts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brelady walked down the narrow path leading towards the Source, interspersed by chasms and huts on either side. The thatches, the lone dry shade of blue-green amidst a sea of sepia and monochrome, waved her by with characteristic gloom. Elders passed her by with cautious, practiced indifference, a vestige of the only eventful day cursed on the Valley in more than a century. She was used to it. Full cloaks tied with carved pine roots over the waist and long hair and beards adorned with dried leaves fluttered in the winds marking their passing by, a lingering earthy fragrance raised beside them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She spied Master Farious standing in front of The Source, his eyes glazed and unfocused. He was renowned among the Mohacans for his mastery over the farsight discipline, and was rumored to be able to look over even the colossal mountains and clouds which marked the end of the explored lands.  But Brelady suspected that the farsight discipline was not everything it was taught to be, for every use of it ended with Master Farious struggling to conceal his pain. She walked up to him just as he exited his trance, his wincing barely suppressed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Hello, Master Farious. I hope this day finds you well.“ said Brelady, concern dripping into her otherwise neutral words.
                    </p>
                        Master Farious face lit up as he heard her voice, for she was dearer to him than to any other elder and he turned to her with a smile as genuine as a smile could be.
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ How could it not, Brelady? Did you think that we would forget?”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “We?” she wondered aloud, just as Thomsa stepped beside her from behind, his familiar easygoing smile stretched across his face. 
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ Happy Birthday, Brel! I was waiting by the northside bridge because I wanted to be the first one to wish you!”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ Well, you are the first one, Thomsa. Now let’s get in and start the lesson before Sylva picks up a random scroll from the shelves and loses herself in it.” said Farious, pointing his cedar staff at the door, his pain all but erased from his manner.
					</p>
					<p>
                        The classroom contained around two dozen initiates in it, with ages ranging from 7 to 40. Aside from Thomsa, Sylva and Brelady, everyone was older than 20. They all were kind and amiable to Thomsa and Sylva, for they believed that they had in them the potential to be elders of the land. Brelady, despite her abilities rivaling theirs, was ostentatiously and ceremoniously ignored.
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ Intiate Slyva, Name the first of the Five Rules.” Farious looked at Sylva pointedly, peering at her down his hawkish nose.
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ The rule of Tranquil Harmony, Master Farious.” answered Syla, her lack of interest in the subject betrayed despite her monotonous tone and placid expression.
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ And what does that say?”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ It posits that the energy instilled in a casting does not arise from vacuum nor does it dissipate into one. That a harmonious casting is created out of a balance between a single source and a single sink.”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “Correct, and what conditions does that set on the Second Rule, Initiate Thomsa?”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “Well, The Second Rule is the Rule of Restricted Simultaneity. It says that at most only two castings can be simultaneously sustained. If we apply the First rule to this, it implies that a caster at most can only deal with two sources and two sinks.”said Thomsa, his wording informal and his attitude laidback.
					</p>
					<p>
                        “That’s right, and what does that mean for the Third Rule, Initiate Brelady?”
					</p>
					<p>
                        “ Well, That’s the Rule of Renewability. It states that a caster’s body is the only living matter capable of being a source. That indicates that there can be a maximum of 4 inorganic energy conduits and a minimum of 3 inorganic energy conduits in a casting,”
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                            In the next three months, you have to figure out and list how each rule changes another.
                    </blockquote>
					<p>
                        “Absolutely correct. Okay, now that winter is almost upon us, we are not going to meet again for quite some time.So I have a quest of sorts for all for you. We have learnt today that rules impose more conditions and thus more structure onto each rule. In the next three months, you have to figure out and list how each rule changes another. Now, I understand that this list would not only be exhaustive but also extremely difficult to deduce. But I trust that at least some of you are capable of completing this task. Also, fair warning, you are not supposed to approach the elders to get answers.” said Master Farious, his eyes reproachful.
