                        <a href = "./chapter2.html">< Chapter 2: She was Seven</a>
                        <hr>
                    </p><p>
                        It was winter. Brelady stood amidst the bristling orange-green grass of the Upper hills, her arms raised in a pacifying gesture, her legs drawn in and her stance guarded. Her Jet black hair, a rarity among the Mohacans, despite the wind serenely cascaded down to her shoulders. Her countenance was pinched, a far cry from her usual stoic expression. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the break of dusk, Brelady made her way down to the village,from the little hamlet she had made her own. She lithely climbed down the ancient steps carved right over the hills, marked on either sides by nothing but the unending craggy vistas as far and long as the horizon. The Village was but an iota of disconsonant colour way beneath her feet, as immaterial as the clouds long way up the cliff. She had made the descent a hundred times over, ever since she had lost her mother and father, and she believed that she could do it now with her arms bound. The mysteries of the hills were long unraveled and posed her questions no more.

                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The Common Hall was the largest hut in the village, more than twice as large as even the Source. A congregating hub for any gathering exceeding double digits, it was the only building in the village whose clay-mud walls were reinforced by spells weaved to withstand curses. The usual custom was to weave spells directed at protecting the walls and the roof from meteorological impacts and general wear and tear, for curses were unimaginably foreign to the quaint, passive dwellers of the quiet valley. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Common Hall also doubled as the communal mess of the village on most days, since it predictably served almost no purpose in a community as isolated and scattered as the Mohacans. Brelady made her way up the stone steps of the hall, and strode in through the large,wide slavishly unadorned doors. She spied Thomsa seated and in the middle of a heated conversation at the end of the hall with his bespectacled, bookish friend Sylva. As she plopped down a large serving of hard yak cheese onto her plate, she wondered how the three of them were friends. Sylva was bookish and timid, and was as uninterested in practical magic as any Mohican could be. She had been reprimanded by the elders several times for her transparent disinterest in the art of. Thomsa, on the other hand stuck to rules in as stringently as he could. His skill with the White Gift, the name with which white magic was known among Mohacans, was unheard for an 8 year old. His skill even exceeded hers in several areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ You two back at it,huh?”asked Brelady, as she seated herself beside Thomsa. Sylva’s hair was a shock of white-grey strands, as white as the winter gulls which seasonly made the hills their homes, and as gray as the rocks that hid beneath the orange-green exterior of the valley. She was gesticulating manically as Brelady made her way to them.

                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        “ He’s mad, Brel. He believes that his skills in the warming discplines would make a night up the Upper hills a cakewalk. God, He would freeze within a few hours. You know the Upper Hills better than most of the adults, Brel. Educate the dunce.”
                    </p>
                    <p>                        
                        “ She’s right, you know? You”, said Brelady, pointing at Thomsa with her cheeseknife, “ wouldn’t last an hour most nights, Thomsa. I sometimes hear the grass shriveling up and shivering by the thousands throughout the night even though they were bred for the cold.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            “ Then, how in the holy hill’s name do you survive up there all alone every single night in that dinged up hut of yours?” asked Thomsa, his brows scrucnched in suspicion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            “ Oh, that’s for me to know and you to find out, Thomsa. By the way how fares Master Farious’s task?“ asked Brelady, her tone nonchalant and her eyes focused on the black-grey discolorations in the cheese.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ I have a few avenues I plan to explore. I believe we must read the history tomes in order to derive the true past of our existence. We are already aware of our bloody eugenic origin and the following exodus, so from that we can conclude the rules were formed somewhere during that period. I am quite certain that the answer to Farious’s quest lies there.” excitedly answered Sylva.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Well, I am going to question all the elders I can find and see if any of them slips up and gives me a hint. I am sure that will be enough to derive an answer to.” said Thomsa with characteristic pomposity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ What about you, Brel? Do you want to come read the tomes with me?” offered Sylva, her eyes brightened with anticipation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ Oh, I plan to find the answers in a different manner, Sylva. Don’t worry about me.” answered Brelady.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ What manner is that? You can’t intimidate a question, you know, you can’t even cajole it. You are out of your element. This answer demands a rigorous, academic process. If the answer was that easy to figure out, we wouldn’t have been given the whole winter.” said Thomsa indignantly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ You are right. The question is impervious to flattery or threats. But I know someone who holds the answers and craves attention.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ Stop lying, Brelady. No elder would even hold a conversation with you, let alone answer your questions.” said Thomsa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “ Who said anything about an elder?” replied Brelady, a slight smile on her face.
