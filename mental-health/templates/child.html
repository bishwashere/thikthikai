                        For those who follow the exhaustive list of James Bond movies, there is one titled: The world is not enough. As catchy as that sounds, its meaning is true for everyone. This is because, although we experience life in different dimensions, the routine cosplay because of societal demands, coupled with the mundane everyday expectations act as an incentive for an individual to escape reality by imagining the possible what if; and this is something that everyone is accustomed to performing. When it is performed in sleep, we call it dreaming and in waking life we call it day dreaming. This urge takes a peculiar form when one's desires are imagined and intricately played out in imagination; we call this fantasizing. These fantasies can be anything, being a king in a far of land, being a spy, a thug, a superhero, etc. Now, since fantasies are based on our desires, they become an integral part of our identity, which seeks expression. And only when it is expressed will we truly understand our selves. Therefore, we seek different forms of expression for our fantasies. Some of them are: watching a movie, day dreaming, role playing, books, music, games, etc.

                        The modern world offers an array of resources to satisfy our needs to express our fantasies. Starting with:

                        With the advent of technological advancement, the fantasy itself has gotten more real. Some of the gadgets that help escape reality are: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, holographic projection, etc.

                        The mind offers a lucrative deal for the purpose of escaping reality; some of the ways that are known to us are: hypnosis, lucid dreaming, etc.

                        Such resources to escape reality are also available in the:

                    <p>
                        The art of meditation offers an escape from reality into a cosmic unity; the oriental tradition offers Astral body projection.

                        Whatever their political stance maybe, recreational drugs offer highly impressionable and methodological feasible ways of escaping reality. Certain drugs can induce long duration hallucinations, like LSD; some offer sensory dilution, like alcohol; some provide sensory stimulation, like Marijuana, etc.

                        Each of these are resources to escape reality and/or play out our fantasies; and the kind of experience one gets hinges on the resource of escape. Virtual reality for example, offers an experience which is very much kin to any waking life experience. We can have an experience of flying, swimming, fighting, shouting a gun, etc. Holographs offer life like interactions with another subject.

                        Lucid dreaming is a kind of dreaming where the dreamer is aware that he/she is in a dream, and hence can manipulate and control the dream as per their will and desire. Since dreams also arouse emotion corresponding to the dream, Lucid dreaming can be wildly entertaining.

                        Astral body projection is a means to escape our body and travel the world in unimaginative speeds. It is also claimed that sex in astral form is extremely pleasurable.  Finally, the pleasures of recreational drugs are something we all are familiar with. The mind-numbing bottle of alcohol is a friend to a person both in his/her good and bad times. Marijuana relieves stress, and who hasn't woken up happy the next morning after smoking up?! Certain hallucinatory drugs like mushrooms are claimed change a person completely to the better.

                        Whatever these resources for escape maybe, the ones that stand out are those that induce the most reality in the fantasy, and those that are induce by our will and control. Surprisingly, this is already been achieved by a young entrepreneur.

                        Hence, in the following article we will provide specific steps and details to escape to a place where anything is possible and it is induced with our own will and control. We will escape this reality to a transcendental sandbox of the mind, together.
