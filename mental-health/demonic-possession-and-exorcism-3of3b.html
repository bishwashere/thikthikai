                        This series is written to give an alternate explanation to the masses. It is in no way meant to hurt any religious sentiments but to start a conversation about the phenomenon. And this conversation is important since, as pointed out earlier, the phenomenon has ethical implications. Although many arguments were presented for the existence of demons, the best to look at it is in isolation. This is were the masses fail. A connection is made between different concepts. Like Ouija board is proposed as a cause for the cause of demonic possession [9]. Therefore, one debunking strategy is to explain the two separately. We will be exploring the debunking of Ouija board further in this article. Meanwhile we will be exploring other research done on DID and its relation to demonic possession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One other paper published in the of Archives of Neurology, conducted a study with 12 patients with clinical EEG manifestations reminiscent of temporal lobe epilepsy reported symptoms of dissociative states. This paper basically suggested that in the observed cases dissociative states may constitute complex behavioural manifestations of chronic limbic epilepsy. Apart from all the technical jargon, the paper records two cases: 1) a 26-year-old, righthanded Roman Catholic woman. She reports multiple episodes of altered consciousness associated with lip smacking and rocking movements. There are also panic episodes, auditory and visual hallucinations, deja vu, and depersonalization. The patient stated her conviction that she is possessed by the devil. She feels that there is a demon in her body who cackles inside her head. She hears his voice telling her to do horrible things, ranging from throwing cups of coffee at other people's faces to killing herself. She was subsequently taken through the rite of exorcism. The priest then announced that she had been exorcised. She is now attending extension courses at the college level and obtaining mostly As. What's interesting in this case the neurological data that was extracted from the patient. The EEG showed anterior bitemporal spikes. Although the CT scan and results of neurological examination are within normal limits. Because of the suggested neurological connection, the supposed supernatural phenomenon of demonic possession can be reduced to neuroscience and explained in a naturalistic way [6].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a certain appeal in explaining the phenomenon of demonic possession as a special type DID (DTD- Dissociative Trance disorder or PTD - Possession Trance disorder). Since some cases of DID or interesting in their own regard. There is one case where a patient who had DID and was blind after a trauma. Surprisingly, during her therapy, some of her alters had vison. Hence, we can make a good case that the mind can supress vision. There is also another case where a person with DID who did nit have diabetes, had diabetes in some of his alters. There is also one other case of changing eye colour in different alters [24]. More and more cases of DID challenge what is possible for the human mind. Hence it isn't hard to imagine demonic possession has a special case of DID. The revised Diagnostic and statistical manual ( DSM-V), suggests the same [25].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also cases out there that are assertively believed to be instances of demonic possession but are later shown otherwise.
                    </p>

                        A 38-year-old, righthanded Roman Catholic man who had no prior history of neurological or psychiatric impairment. Who was operated on to remove an abscess (a localized collection of pus). Two years after surgery, he had a grand mal seizure that prompted hospitalization. He was not unusually religious, but become preoccupied with religion after surgery and started to write excessively even though he was virtually illiterate. The patient kept voluminous notes concerning his spells in which his beliefs of the devil trying to get inside was expressed. The patient repeated his conviction that the devil was actually inside his body. As proof for this demonic possession, he related frightening nightmares and thoughts of raping his own daughters. He kept repeating that there are "demons within me."

                    <p>
                        The EEG showed a sharp wave and spike focus mostly on the right mid-temporal area. The CT scan showed an area of low density in the right parietooccipital region. Neurological examination showed sensory extinction on the left. The patient did very well after receiving proper medication. The various manifestations disappeared and he stopped believing that he was possessed [6].

                    <p>
                        A 22-year-old unemployed Hindu Indian male, an aunt, jealous of the success of the patient's family, fed him and his elder brother cursed sweet rice, rendering them susceptible to spirit possession. His family had sent him to holy places in India where he was exorcised, by a Hindu priest and later a Moslem peer. Impatient with the failure, which seemed to increase the ghost's anger, he unsuccessfully consulted Christian priests. Routine tests revealed that the patient was normal. These tests included EEG and tomography. The patient was diagnosed with Dissociative sate or paranoid schizophrenia. Exorcism having failed, he was prescribed relevant medication (trifluoperazine (4mg daily)) producing apparent remission and remaining in remission 12 weeks after [7].

                    <p>
                        There is also one very interesting case that is worth accounting for - the exorcism of Martha Brossier. Martha Brossier was a celebrity in France in the 1590s. She was a woman possessed by demons and her family took "the act" on tour. They went from town-to-town showing off the Satanic entity that resided within their child's soul, all before a packed crowd. It caught so much attention that King Henri IV himself ordered her exorcism. Martha Brossier was brought to the Abbey of St. Geneuesua, to be exorcised, under Marescot's watch, by the Bishop of Paris himself. He had some of the highest priests in the country gather around her, sprinkling her with holy water and reciting scriptures in Latin while the demon in Brossier, tormented by the Holy Scriptures, screamed in agony and pain. Michel Marescot, the personal physician to King Henri IV, was given the task of exposing her. Marthe Brossier was brought to the Abbey of St. Geneuesua, to be exorcised, under Marescot's watch, by the Bishop of Paris himself. Nearly as soon as Brossier kneeled down with the bishop to pray, the demon took hold of her. She fell onto her back, convulsing and breathing like a wild animal. Her eyes turned back in her head, her tongue flared out, and a dark, gravelly voice from within her stomach shouted vulgar, unprintable words. But what Brossier didn't know was that her exorcism was a sham. The holy water was just ordinary water, and the Latin books the priests were reading were nothing more than an old poem by Virgil [17]. It can be understood that the ritual of exorcism acted as a suggestive situation for her to play out her so-called demonic entity. But since the ritual itself was a scam, we can safely infer that the demons are a scam and hence, unreal as well.

                    <p>
                        A similar view on the phenomenon of demonic possession is held by Christopher Charles French is a British psychologist specialising in the psychology of paranormal beliefs and experiences, cognition and emotion (a debunker). Possession is categorised into Central possession: The person possessed is a respected member of the society and the possession spirit is usually a deity and the performance serve to reinforce the central values of the society. Butha Kola in Coastal Karnataka is a good example of central possession. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In peripheral possession: The person possessed person is a socially marginal and powerless member of the society. The possessing spirit is usually a capricious and amoral. The performance is typically associated with illness and distress on the part of the possessed. Chris French further argues that whole ritual has social significance; since the exorcists are seen as powerful people who fight against evil. Hence their role in the society gets emphasised and for the possessed, the ritual is a platform to enact their otherwise socially tabooed or unaccepted desires [18].

                    <p>
                        There are other reasons why the phenomenon of exorcism and possession may not be because of real demons. The most pressing reason for this is that all religions are able to conduct exorcisms, and these are different religions having different theological, metaphysical and ethical views. Therefore, there has to be something that is similar to exorcisms in all religions, which is - human psychology or human mind. Furthermore, any steps taken to untie the practice across all religions is rigged with difficulty. Take for example the reasons given by Father Gabreile Amorth, an Italian Roman Catholic priest and an exorcist of the diocese of Rome who performed tens of thousands of exorcisms over his sixty plus years as a Catholic Priest [8]. According to Father Amorth, "yoga is "evil" because it leads to a worship of Hinduism and other Eastern religions, and that the Harry Potter books encourage children to believe in black magic and wizardry" [16]. A similar view is held by Father Malaci Martin in his book - Hostage to the devil (a New York times best seller). According to M. Martin, transcendental meditation in its nature of attitudes is one of the most common disposing factors for someone to susceptible to demonic possession [9]. Now, regardless of what the opinions of these two priests actually mean, just the view that yoga is demonic or may lead to demon possession is antithetic to Indian religions, since yoga and meditation are considered as instruments to attain salvation (moksha/nirvana) in Indian religions.

                    <p>
                        Contrary to the assertion by the Catholic Church, most exorcisms aren't tested for physical or mental ailments. This is because, most exorcisms take place at retreat centres where there is prayer, fasting and then exorcism on spot. The same goes for Hindu and Islamic exorcisms. Even in official sanctioned exorcisms, the possessed have a history of mental illness or abuse [5]. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, contrary to the popular held belief, exorcism isn't always successful and there are tons of cases out there that have led to death and torture [26] [27].

                    <h3>
                        A philosophical Approach:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Vedantic Indian philosophy argues for the Brahaman (God) and a part of it which is called the Athman (soul). The debate whether the Brahaman is identical in all aspects to the Athman gives rise to two schools of Indian philosophy called Dvaitha and Advaitha. The former school is a dualist, which argues that the athman is of a lesser degree than the Brahaman and the latter argues that the Brahaman and the athman are identical in all regard. Now, given this understanding of the Vedantic philosophy, a question arises on how a body which contains the Brahaman can be occupied by a demonic entity? The simple answer is NO; it cannot occupy. And this reasoning is consistent with the categories these philosophers make about the human body. The human body has a material body, a soul, a mind and also the self. Hence demonic possession can be understood as an intrusion or alteration of the self or the mind [19]. Coincidentally, this reasoning is consistent with the findings of modern psychiatry and psychology. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Western philosophy, when there are two contending theories that explain the same phenomena, we a principle called The Occam's Razor which is a guiding tool in choosing the right theory. Basically, every theory has certain predicates that are irreducible [22]. For example: All fundamental particles in physics are irreducible. While theorizing certain irreducible are formed from observation and some are posited to explain a phenomenon. For example, in J J Thompson's Experiment, to explain the phenomenon in his experiment, a negatively charged electron was posited. Now, Occam's Razor says that while choosing between contending theories, we choose the simplest one; meaning, a theory with lesser number of irreducible. Debunkers knowingly or unknowingly use Occam's Razor in their analysis of the supernatural. Ouija boards are debunked with the help of Occam's Razor. Basically, through controlled experiments, it is shown that the game can be explained with Naturalism (that is, with all that we know about science and psychology). Finally, Occam's Razor is employed to eliminate the spirit entity that people usually believe moves the dial of the Ouija board. In simple terms, when all the observed phenomenon can be explained with Naturalist theory, then why posit a supernatural entity to explain the same phenomenon? [21]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, giving due consideration to all that we have gathered and accounted for, it be seem that phenomenon of exorcism is real, but it has its roots in psychology and psychiatry. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the ritual has therapeutic and to suspend judgement on existence of demons. The reason to take this agnostic position is for the very fact that we shouldn't consider people as idiots just because they make improbable claims. There is some doubt in this regard. Therefore, to understand the phenomenon better, more research is required; research on official sanctioned exorcisms. Certain claims of levitation and spiting of transistors, iron pieces and glass shards are of grave concern to science. Then considering the whole engaged process of exorcism, it may be possible that the exorcists are affected by it as well. As Freud put it, "No one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human breast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed". From all the background knowledge that we have, the above is impossible; but since the claims are assertively made by the exorcists, research in this field is justified. Some philosophical reason for opting for more research is because of Nelson Goodman's new riddle of Induction, which challenges the background data. Secondly, if Thomas Kuhn is right on how scientific revolutions take place, and assuming that levitation does occur, this phenomenon will be a good starting point for a new scientific revolution to take place [23]
