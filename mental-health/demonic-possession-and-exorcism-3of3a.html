                    <p>
                        After considering the evidence, or if u would say, suggestive evidence, there may be little reason to doubt at least the existence of the phenomenon of possession and exorcism; but it would be hasty to conclude that there are real demons. Whatever the data on the number of exorcisms suggests, the phenomenon of demonic possession and exorcism isn't usually observed blatantly around us. The fact that possession and exorcism hasn't caught the attention of scientists and researchers is proof for this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before directly accounting for a scientific explanation for the phenomenon of demonic possession, let us first address the rising numbers for the cases of demonic possession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although there is some evidence suggesting a drastic increase in the cases of exorcisms, these aren't from any official reports from the catholic church. On the contrary, the church doesn't keep any records on the conducted exorcisms. Most of the references that are usually cited is from anecdotal evidence or testimonies by exorcists; these are articles written by journalists after interviewing exorcists [1], and these form the cause for the alarm regarding the increasing number. It is not that anecdotal and testimonial evidence should be outrightly dismissed, but such form of evidence is subject to a lot of errors and biases. Therefore, such evidence must be dealt with cautions and not alarm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even then, let us, for instance entertain the testimonial data. Consider the following two: 1) In the United States, according to Catholic theologian Malachi Martin, there was "a 750 percent increase in the number of Exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s" [10]. 
                        2) We have also seen another testimonial data in the previous article, which suggested that in 2018 alone, father Vincent Lambert had received 1700 requests for exorcisms [1].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first insight we get from the above testimonial data is that, there has always been a claim for the rising number of cases of demonic possession. Secondly, the numbers seem to be inconsistent. For if there was a 750% increase in the number of exorcisms in a span of approximately 15 years (1960-1970), the number of cases father Vincent Lambert would have received should have been way more than 1700.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a calculation. By using the formula:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A * (1+k)<sup>n</sup> = Total number of cases in a span of 15 years, <br/>
                        Here, A = Initial number of cases<br/>
                        k =  percentage of increase in number of cases<br/>
                        n =  number of years<br/>
                        <br/>
                        if we assumed that between 1960-1970, there were 100 exorcisms, <br/>
                        where k =7.5 (from the testimonial data percentage my M. Martin), <br/>
                        we get 100*(1+7.5)<sup>n</sup> = 5,22,006.25 between 2005-2020.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Considering that there are 15 exorcists in the US [11], 1700*15=25,500 which is nowhere near to the projected number; and this is assuming that the number of cases between 1960-1970 is 100! Hundred is a very small number of cases. If we assume a higher initial number, and an increasing rate of exorcism (rather assuming 750% to be the constant rate), the projected number would have been drastically high. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An estimated 38,700 Americans became newly infected with HIV in 2016 [12]. Comparing this number with the above calculated 25,500, it would seem improbable that HIV goes widely noticed and demonic possession doesn't!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris French in his lecture gives us observation on the evolution of exorcisms, and claims that exorcism was tool used for proselytising. The rate of occurrence was high in the early days of Christianity; since they had to prove they Christianity is the one true from of religion.  It declined once Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, and rose again between the 16th and the 17th centuries, with the breakup of Christianity into competing sects [17]. If exorcism is tool for conversion then, the rising numbers of exorcisms would make a lot of sense, since atheism is on the rise as well.

                    <p>
                        A YouTube channel- Religion for breakfast did a collaborative video with Dr Jason   Joseph Sandstorm, a scholar of religion and the author of the book- The myth of disenchantment. on the rising number with. He suggests a few reasons why there could be a rising number of exorcisms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pop Culture: The movie, The Exorcist was released in the year 1973. We view our reality through the lens of pop culture, it makes sense that many people think about demons and try to envision demonic possession, based on what they see in movies videos games and television. Therefore, a certain rise in the fascination with the occult and demons would probably give rise to an increase in the number of cases of demonic possession. This is exactly what is observed. A Gallup poll and YouGov poll showed that, between 1990 and 2007, there was increase in the belief of demons and the occult from 55% to 70% [13].

                    <p>
                        Changes in theology: Pentecostal Christianity is the fastest growing Christianity in the world. Pentecostal Christianity is highly focused on spiritual realm and spiritual gifts. Hence the rising rates of exorcisms could be rising in tandem with the general rise in the Pentecostal Christianity in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Changes in mental health needs: The increase in the number of people affected by mental illness and religious interpretation of it might be the cause of the rising number of exorcisms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Changing religious landscape: Since the US is becoming more pluralistic. Hence it is possible that we are seeing some sort of anxiety between religious communities. This might generate a vibe that there is some sort of demonic activity in their neighbourhood [15].

                        Capitalism: Capitalism itself- the unpredictability of the market, contributes to different kinds of enchanted beliefs. Some of the examples are the notion that people are cursed or possessed. A sudden bankruptcy or if people suddenly get a lot money. Our curiosity to explain fortune or misfortune gives rise to occult, paranormal and supernatural beliefs [14]. In India we see this prevailing among Gold manufacturers, farmers, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Depending on the community, the phenomenon of exorcism has been dealt in different ways. The religious tend to fully or partially accept it. Whereas the rational thinkers in the community tend to approach it with scepticism. One such group are widely known as the debunkers. These people investigate a wide range of paranormal and supernatural claims extending from ESP, telekinesis, exorcisms, Ouija boards, even haunted places, etc.  Some notable debunkers are Chris French, James Randi, Joe nickel, Michael Shermer, Steven Novella, etc. But there is a specific kind of problem with the debunkers approach towards the phenomenon of exorcism, which is- they are too sceptical to the point of cynicism. Consider the following explanations:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is from a blog article by Steven Novella on Dr Richard Gallagher. Although he makes a lot of sensible points, in some places the scepticism just overflows. Regard the following, "It's not hard to have thing fall of shelves, or even fly across the room. You can just throw it. Did Julia throw the book when no one was watching? Did she have an accomplice? Did a book just fall off the shelf because of other commotion in the room? I don't know, because we are not provided actual evidence to investigate, only word of mouth" [2]. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following is from a blog article by Joe Nickel on a case of 200 demons in a house which went viral in the media, where, among many other supernatural occurrences that were reported, Joe Nickel tries to give an explanation to the boy who was reported walking on the hospital ceiling. "In fact, while the boy put first one foot, then the other, onto the wall of a small hospital exam room, his grandmother, Rosa Campbell, was holding his hand, or both hands. Thus, the laws of physics were not contravened. The boy was obviously supported, braced by the rigid arms of Campbell" [3]. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Joe Nickel does a really good job investigating the case and giving alternate explanation which are compatible with the known universe, but at some places, the scepticism becomes too extreme. It is as if he, and most other debunkers are stubborn to the point that they wouldn't even consider the phenomenon of demonic possession as a true occurrence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have clarified the problem with the debunkers, we will explore the research done in the discipline of psychiatry and psychology on the phenomenon of demonic possession. Again, to go ahead, we must first admit the phenomenon is real. (Some of the following explanation gets technical but it's worth reading)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A paper published in the journal of 'Mental Health, Religion and Culture' in 2015, where the researchers did a phenomenological study on 17 individuals participating in a Pentecostal deliverance ceremony organised by a Nigerian-based Pentecostal church, and their descriptions of discerning demon possession, undergoing exorcism/deliverance, and their condition immediately following. Among the 17 participants/congregants, 16 were female and one was male. The participants reported continuous nightmares that interfered with their life; which they interpreted as signs of demonic possession. The dreams that they reported were mostly about a "spiritual husband" who would come in their dreams to sleep with them. The male participant had a different dream. He describes his nightmares where he is hanging or falling in his dreams, and that he dreams of the ocean and a big storm. They also reported loss of control and loss of subjective experience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The paper suggests that, considering the phenomenological report by the participants, the phenomenon of possession appropriately falls directly under the DSM-V, Criteria A for Dissociative Identity Disorder. The participants described experiences of a distinct loss of control during the possession similar to descriptions of experience of passivity associated with schizophrenia [4].  It attempts to make a correlation between psychosis and nightmares by drawing evidence from psychology and psychiatry. And the whole phenomenon of demonic possession is explained in three ways: Possession and "positive" experiences of communicating with god, Spirit possession and psychotic disorders, Nightmares and psychotic disorders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The above isn't the only paper that has attempted to make a connection between DID and demonic possession. One paper published in the journal of Personality Assessment also attempts the same. In this study, the researchers contacted official exorcists of the Rome diocese. In 1 year, the observer attended more than 400 ritual treatments involving over 100 persons. Only those persons were included if they clearly acted out during exorcism an altered pattern of behaviour-unlike their normal behaviour-consisting of facial expressions and physical manifestations appropriate to the statements made during this state of altered consciousness (e.g., saying "I am Satan").  Sixteen of the 100 persons observed fitted these criteria and were invited to attend individual testing sessions in the office of one of the authors. Only 10 persons, 3 men and 7 women, accepted the invitation. All participants were administered the complete DDIS (Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule) translated into Italian, the Standard Progressive Matrices 1938, and the Rorschach. The following was observed in the participants during exorcism: The possessed persons had frequent vomiting, coughing, and spitting, accompanied by roars, growls and barks. During the possession state these people usually had facial expressions of anger and hate. One person, a former seminarist, talked in bad Latin. The possessing agent, in these cases always a devil, usually identified itself as male. Motor behaviour always became intense, agitated, and aggressive. The eyes rolled, and the voice became deep and gloomy. Interestingly, during the possession state 1 participant, talking as the demon and using the first person, spontaneously stated that the "bodily flesh" he had entered had been sexually abused in childhood. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results: DDSI results showed that many participants had c1inical features of DID, with a high mean score for DID symptoms (9.3, SD = 3.13). They also had various features typical of DID, including the experience of finding unexplainable objects in their environment, noticing a change in handwriting, amnesias, and flashbacks. Interestingly, they denied all forms of sexual abuse in childhood. The participant who had talked about such experiences occurring in the body he had entered during his "demon state" firmly denied childhood sexual abuse when interviewed during his normal state of consciousness. The Rorschach traumatic response subscale revealed a low mean index value. The person with the highest traumatic phenomena score (Case 7) was the one who, speaking as the possessing agent, stated during the possession trance that the body he was in had been abused. DID is treated through therapy which aims integrate the ego which has been split into different personalities. But in cases of possession - as understood as DID or DTD-, exorcism seems to be the appropriate solution [5].
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "If the entity is considered as a part of the same person, the treatment will attempt to develop to integration (i.e., intensive psychotherapy); if the secondary conscious is diagnosed as a spirit or demon, the treatment will be organized around the theme of expulsion".
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Note: In psychoanalysis, the ego is the part of the mind which mediates between our immediate desires (the ID) and our self-critical conscience, reflecting learned social standards from the immediate environment (superego). Splitting of the ego causes multiple personality alters. This is at least one of the explanations of the phenomenon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next article we will address the phenomenon of exorcism directly from a philosophical perspective and also the significance of the relation between DID and possession will be addressed. It will also include some alternate arguments trying to rationally refute the claims about the reality of demons.
