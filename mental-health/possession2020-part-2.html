                        The previous article was aimed at exploring different mental disorders which are or which could be misconstrued as cases of demonic possession. The aim of this article is to 1) present arguments for the real existence of demonic possession, and 2) attempt to refute those arguments with the existing research. So, is there any reason to believe in the existence of supernatural demons that cause afflictions to human beings?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For people who are willing to keep an open mind and consider evidence where it is due, there is an abundance of supernatural experiences that people have experienced. Consider it this way, in any family, there is at least one relative who has had an experience of the supernatural: either seen a ghost, been to a haunted place, experienced witchcraft or were possessed and exorcised etc. It is usually ignored that, for the most part, these people are sane with no history of mental illness. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The church has a special group of ordained priests who have been educated in demonology and the art of exorcism. For the catholic church, solemn exorcisms require permission from the diocese bishop and careful medical examination to exclude any possibility of mental illness [1].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These beliefs are age old and prevalent in virtually every religion. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Contrary to common belief, the belief in the supernatural still hasn't disappeared in the modern society; but it's rather increased. The chief exorcist for the archdiocese of Indianapolis, Vincent Lambert testified that he had received 1700 requests for exorcisms in 2018; which is more than what he's received in his whole career [2]. Outside the US, there is also a rise in the cases of exorcism. According to a Sicilian priest, there were now, he said, 500,000 alleged cases of demonic possession recorded in Italy each year [3]. A CNN article talks about an ivy league qualified psychiatrist - Dr. Richard Gallagher, who after an encounter with a patient - who was supposedly possessed - has started to believe in the reality of demons [4].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The church also conducts courses to train priests in the art of exorcism and demonology [5].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The rite of exorcism isn't just restricted to Roman Catholicism, almost every Christian denomination, and virtually every religion has the rite of exorcism. In India, there are dedicated temples to exorcise spirits or demons that possess and/or afflict individuals. Harsu Brahm temple on the Bihar-UP border is one such temple. There are also mosques that are dedicated for the same [6]. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A Youtuber, Rob dyke has a video which gives an account of a few reported cases of demonic possessions, which include one case of levitation that was witnessed by about 50 people, one case where the possessed spoke in multiple beastlike voices, etc [7].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Weird as it may sound, there is also a documented case of werewolf possession. It was covered by the Warrens, and they reported that the ears and the nails of the possessed had grown and become pointed; just like a werewolf [8].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Just a quick Wikipedia search will give a list of notable cases of exorcisms; [10] like the exorcism of Anneliese Michel, a girl who was claimed to have been possessed by 6 demons- those who possessed Cain, Nero, and Judas Iscariot, a member of Legion, Belial, and Lucifer himself [9]. This case later inspired the movie, "The exorcism of Emily Rose". One other notable case is of Roland Doe which later became the movie, "The Exorcist". 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ian Prettyman Stevenson was a Canadian-born U.S. psychiatrist, published a paper which accounts a young married woman, Sumitra, in a village of northern India, apparently died and then revived. After a period of confusion, she stated that she was one Shiva who had been murdered in another village. The revived Sumitra gave enough details to permit verification of her statements, which corresponded to facts in the life of another young married woman called Shiva. Subsequently, Sumitra recognized 23 persons (in person or in photographs) known to Shiva. She also showed in several respects new behaviour that accorded with Shiva's personality and attainments [11].
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The above are some of arguments to make a case for the existence of demons and the supernatural; no doubt there could be many other cases that can testify for the same. But before exploring the refutation, we must first illuminate what is at stake and what would be the consequence if the existence of such supernatural forces is included into our ontology.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                So, including the existence of demons to the known world means a clear denial of materialism, physicalism, etc. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exorcism and demons cannot be accepted in isolation. Accepting the existence of demons also entails accepting the powers of the occult, witchcraft, Ouija boards, black eye, levitation, souls, astrology, believing in the powers in the lunar cycles as a force that influences spirts and humans, etc. The problem in accepting these is that they are incompatible with the years of research and scientific knowledge that has been tested and proved. Consider levitation for instance; which natural law would explain a person hovering in the air? Clearly it defies the laws of gravity and thermodynamics.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It promotes superstition and it will dictate the way of life and ethics of society. There are certain religious denominations who believe in the gay demon. Hence, they find it appropriate to exorcise a gay person; and these exorcisms are gruesome [12][13]. Therefore, having homosexual urges would be deemed as demonic and hence will be disapproved. The Pentecostal church believes that diseases- both mental and physical- are sent by the devil to cause afflictions to humans, and prayer or exorcism is the right solution. In the Pentecostal view, mental illnesses, including autism, bipolar disorder, depression, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and schizophrenia, all have their direct causes in the presence or 'indwelling' of demons who have entered the victim's body [14].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There is political angle to this as well. Such beliefs will legitimize the authority of the church and any other organised religion; hence cause a power shift. In other words, it is a device to reconvert the masses into their religious organization; especially those who usually question the dogmatic authority of the church or any other organised religion.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Atheism will be irrational and in retrospect, atheists will look foolish.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next article, we will be exploring the research and arguments from the field of psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology and philosophy. The next article will conclude this series and attempt to argue against the existence of demons.
