                    <p>Lets discuss hate culture.</p>
                    <p>Why is youtube filled with Android vs iOS debates? Why people discriminate on skin color to this day? Why is there fight in the name of politics? or religion?These type of hate culture, that's been going around lately on religion, commodity, place, skin, food, almost anything, got me thinking about the ultimate question, "Why humans hate?"</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tendency of humans towards hatred</h2>
                    <p>In the 20th century, Paul Ekman, an American psychologist, identified Six basic emotions: joy, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear and anger.  Among these, anger is a complex emotion. Anger leads to quarrel, assault, the silent treatment or many of the other imaginative behavioral stance that people may resort to; which is all motivated by hatred. But what is hatred? Why do humans have a proclivity for hatred?</p>
                    <p>One of the characteristics of hatred is the need to devalue the victim more and more. At the end of the process, the object of the hatred loses all moral or human consideration in the eyes of the hater. Hatred can manifest in violence, like if I decide that my fist looks better on your face and then your face on the floor. But our society and our upbringing doesn’t encourage violence. Therefore, our human development has been so sophisticated that we even have gained some forms of verbal aggression of great subtlety, e.g. irony. It is said that Winston Churchill was once arguing in the British parliament with an opposition MP. At one moment, the MP got up from her seat and chided Churchill, saying: - "Mr. Churchill, if I were your wife, I would make you a cup of poisoned tea.”  To which Churchill answered - "Madam, if I were your husband, I would drink it!". Such form of passive aggressive hatred is what we have come to witness in the social media these days. The trolling, the hate speech, hacking etc. The internet also offers the added luxury of anonymity; which acts as a catalyst for the hater to express his/her views, with all the force of expression, with his/her words while keeping an indifferent face and chugging on Cheetos.</p>
                    <blockquote>At one moment, the MP got up from her seat and chided Churchill, saying: - "Mr. Churchill, if I were your wife, I would make you a cup of poisoned tea.”  To which Churchill answered - "Madam, if I were your husband, I would drink it!".</blockquote>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Still, why hate?</h2>
                    <p>But why do we hate? And how does hatred develop? To answer this, we must illuminate some ideas by the father of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud. According to Freud, humans have basic instincts, like hunger, thirst, sex etc. This physical instinct produces a corresponding mental energy which is called psyche. Freud differentiates between two types of instincts: The life instinct, which gives rise to the psyche energy called libido and the death instinct. Now, both these instincts are projected on or invested in others. Therefore, we don’t see our own mortality but project this death anxiety onto others by hatred and violence. (Hence the infamous quote, “the world is driven by sex and violence”). Therefore, Hatred is because of the things we fear in ourselves. For example: The hatred, by some men towards expressive and liberated women stems from one’s own insecurity, that such women will undermine the social power that men have. This insecurity manifests have hatred towards women.</p> 
                    <p>In social psychology certain factors are identified that increase or decrease the tendency of hatred. The main factor is when individuals are in a mob. 
                    Hatred can also stem from the fear of the unknown other. The unknown other is perceived as a threat. This triggers certain survival mechanism, which involve identifying ourselves with a group find reassurance and by then, developing hatred towards the perceived threat. Hence hatred is driven by two key emotions of love and aggression. Love towards one’s own and aggression towards the perceived threat.</p>
                    <blockquote>Psychologist Bernard Golden,  believes that when hate involves participation in a group, it may help foster a sense of connection and camaraderie that fills a void in one’s identity.</blockquote> 
                    <p>There is also a cultural and religious aspect of hatred. Cultural and religion conditions the thinking of an individual and the values and virtues taught, eventually breeds hatred towards everything that goes against its teaching.</p>
                    <p>Knowing these reasons will help us understand our own self and thus help in reducing the hate in this world. </p>
