                        We live in the 21st century where we have fast food, advanced technology, fashionable apparel, sports, games, talk shows, Netflix for entertainment, climate change, bad politics, basically all the good stuff. As some would say, we have passed through the age of enlightenment where logic and reason emerged as values and we are now in the postmodern age. But has scientific progress swept away all the superstition and irrational beliefs? Sadly, it hasn't and we still see such beliefs lurking around and also growing in number among people. I suppose everybody is entitled to their beliefs no matter how irrational those beliefs might be, but the problem occurs when people with such beliefs have power. Some beliefs are more assertive than others, give a person with such beliefs power and its just a matter of time when they start to impose it on others. Then again, in actuality, we can't be certain of how they would behave when in power but at least one real problem of the so-called irrational beliefs are the claims they make about the reality.

                        Since the past decade, we have seen a rapid popularization of Atheism, and it has been marketed as a brand of rational and progressive belief system. Much of this is probably true. Even as a human being we are supposed to follow reason. That is why I write this article.  Its purpose is to look at mental illness and particular disorders that the society perceives as cases of spirit possessions, to explore the phenomenon of exorcism through disciplines like philosophy, psychiatry-psychology, religion, and science, finally to conclude based on the evidence and arguments that I have presented.

                        <h3>
                            A few mental disorders that are misunderstood as cases of possession:
                        </h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About four years back, one of my cousins fell sick and was diagnosed with malaria. After a week of taking meds and suffering through the ordeal, he got better. A few weeks later his behavior was changed. He was highly energetic, would speak non-stop, had trouble sleeping. In the beginning, everyone just didn't take much heed to the change but as time went on, he became extremely hard to control as he started to involve himself in risky behavior like going to the terrace and banging on the shutters up there. His family is well educated and moderately religious, except his mother, who could be described as a living saint. So they took him to a priest who initially counseled him in a very unprofessional way mind you, but later when the priest started to pray over him as he was kneeling, he slowly started to bow down and fell over the priest's leg and stayed there till at the end of the prayer. He would stay in the bathroom for hours, having a bath and claiming he sees things in the mirror. He was later admitted and when we had all gone to see him, we saw him emerge from the restroom wearing a black scarf which covered his whole face and we all saw him dramatically removing the scarf while he looked at him with wide opened eyes. Just before he was admitted though, by the advice of the counselor priest and his relatives, his family figured it would be best to consult a psychiatrist, and fortunately, we could breathe a sigh of relief as the doctor diagnosed him with Bipolar disorder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is one case where a mental disorder was initially misunderstood to be a case of spirit possession. One cross-cultural study which was done by the mental health division of the WHO showed the numerous pathways which mental patients take before referring a psychiatrist and some pathways involved a reference from a native faith healer [1]. In the pretext of religion and superstition, every erratic behavior would probably be construed as a case of spirit possession or oppression, so here is a list of mental disorders and symptoms which can be misunderstood as cases of spirit possession.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Bipolar disorder:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This disorder affects about 60 million people worldwide. It typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, over-activity, the pressure of speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep [2].
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Schizophrenia
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, affecting about 23 million people worldwide.  The symptoms can come and go, too. No one has all of them all of the time. They usually start between ages 16 and 30. Men often get them earlier than women. Often there is a gradual change in the person before obvious symptoms start. This is sometimes called the prodrome phase.  Symptoms include highly exaggerated ideas, perceptions, or actions that show the person can't tell what's real from what isn't. These include visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory hallucinations. Delusions of different sorts like a grandiose sense of self, a belief that the person is being followed, that one has a special relationship with a deity or a belief that one is possessed by the devil. Symptoms also include moment disorder where some people with schizophrenia can seem jumpy. Sometimes they'll make the same movements over and over again. But sometimes they might be perfectly still for hours at a stretch. Contrary to popular belief, people with the disease usually aren't violent. Other symptoms are concentration trouble, confused thoughts, and disorganized speech [3].  From these enumerated symptoms, it is easy to understand why this mental disorder can be commonly misconstrued as a case of possession. The person just isn't normal and certain delusions that the patient might have can confirm the people around him/her that the person is indeed possessed, but in reality, it's just a case of schizophrenia.

                    <h3>
                        Alien hand
                    </h3> 
                    <p>
                        Alien hand syndrome is a phenomenon in which one hand is not under control of the mind. The person loses control of the hand, and it acts as if it has a mind of its own. The etiology includes neurosurgery, tumor, aneurysms, and rarely stroke [4].
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        The Cotard Delusion
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Cotard delusion is a rare condition marked by the false belief that you or your body parts are dead, dying, or don't exist. It usually occurs with severe depression and some psychotic disorders. It can accompany other mental illnesses and neurological conditions. One of the main symptoms of Cotard delusion is nihilism. Nihilism is the belief that nothing has any value or meaning [5]. Depression is also closely related to Cotard delusion. A 2011 review of existing research about Cotard delusion notes that 89% of documented cases include depression as a symptom [6]. Other symptoms include anxiety, preoccupation with hurting oneself, hallucinations and guilt.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. There are different types of epilepsy so in general, symptoms include temporary confusion, a starting spell,  Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu [7].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In actuality, any mental disorder can be misconstrued as a case of demonic possession or oppression under the religious pretext. The Pentecostal churches uphold a similar belief. In official sanctioned exorcisms by the Catholic church, the church upholds that all psychological issues be ruled out by a trained psychiatrist to confirm that the person is indeed possessed by an evil spirit. Therefore, in the following articles, we will elaborately explore the religious perspective on demonic possession and some specific research from psychiatry, neurobiology, psychology and also some arguments from philosophy.
