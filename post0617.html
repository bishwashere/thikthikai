                        I am a woman. Although I don’t fully know what ‘being a woman means’, still, I am one.  Am I essentially ‘feminine’; is it that I am supposed to be having certain necessary cognitive and behavioral traits that are immutable throughout time? So then, would you deny my womanhood if I thought, walked, spoke and behaved otherwise?   ‘Tot a mulier in utero’, says one, 'woman is a womb'; am I supposed to have certain biological anatomy? If this is true then would you deny to perceive someone else' behavioral and cognitive mannerisms as ill-desired acts, if the person’s sex was male? If such perception was true then wouldn’t that undermine the validity of personal testimony?  If my functioning as a female is not enough to define woman, I am not be to defined as the ‘eternal feminine’, and since I do exit, then the question still stands, what am I? what is a woman? Men can think of himself without a woman, hence he decrees, a woman has, ‘the sex’, by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him, she is sex - absolute sex, no less [1]. It is evident that there are, in the majority, two types of humans- the male and the female. The problem with every proposed definition of, ‘the woman' is that, such attempts are always rigged with a relative construal of women, i.e. women are defined with respect to men. Men are understood as complete and as an epitome of what it means to be human, whereas women are always understood as defective, as being too emotional, too weak, too dependent, etc. And such an understanding is a result of the presupposed relativity in our understanding. But I am not how you understand or conceptualize me through your presupposed perceptions. ‘I am a woman'; on this truth must be based all further discussion.

                        There is a practical question to be asked here: how has this affirmation helped society and women? Well, its utility can be seen in the strong and independent women who have inculcated this aphorism. To get a good realization of its power, we must illuminate a list of some of the women who have ‘made it': the successful women. These women are feminists by their deeds and not by activism. So, in no particular order:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Oprah Winfrey:</b>
                                The illegitimate daughter of a Mississippi sharecropper, she overcame poverty, parental neglect, sexual abuse, and racism to become one of the richest and most powerful women in the entertainment industry. 
                                She is best known for hosting her own internationally popular talk show, ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show’ from 1986 to 2011. From there, she launched her television network, OWN. 
                                According to Forbes magazine, Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century and the world's only Black billionaire for three years running. Life magazine hailed her as the most influential woman of her generation. 
                                In 2005, Business Week named her the greatest Black philanthropist in American history. Oprah's Angel Network has raised more than $50 million for charitable programs, including girls' education in South Africa and relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Winfrey is a dedicated activist for children's rights; in 1994, President Bill Clinton signed a bill into law that Winfrey had proposed to Congress, creating a nationwide database of convicted child abusers.<br>

                                <b>Margrett Hamilton:</b>
                                On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 astronauts succeeded in their goal, landing with near-flawless precision. And if you aren’t aware, Margaret Hamilton is the engineer who got us there. She took humanity to the Moon. 
                                Hamilton wrote the code for Apollo 11's onboard flight software, and as a result of her work, she received NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award.
                                If that’s not enough, she is also credited with coining the term “software engineering.”
                                Hamilton was the recipient of various honors, including NASA's Exceptional Space Act Award (2003). Pres. Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.<br>

                                <b>Emmy Noether:</b>
                                Ever wondered why there are so many conservation laws in physics? There is a conversation of energy, charge, mass, etc. Well, Noether was a Jewish mathematician who answered that by proving, ‘The Noether's Theorem'. Noether divined a link between two important concepts in physics: conservation laws and symmetries. The certainty of energy conservation helps physicists solve many problems, from calculating the speed of a ball rolling down a hill to understanding the processes of nuclear fusion.
                                The biggest contributions to the world of mathematics that Emmy made were to abstract algebra. 
                                She was recognized as the Ackermann-Teubner Memorial Prize winner, which is the biggest honor that you can receive in mathematics. This was when Emmy finally stopped being viewed as a female mathematician and finally seemed to get recognition for just being one of the very best mathematicians in the world. She no longer was held back by her sex.<br>

                                <b>J.K Rowling:</b>
                                Who hasn’t heard of J.K Rowling? For those who haven’t, well, at least you’ve watched the Harry Potter series right; she is the author of the Harry Potter books. 
                                Today, the Harry Potter franchise is worth an estimated $15 billion. A global brand, it has created world records in literary circles and continues to be the most loved fiction tale. The last four books of the series have broken all records to become the fastest selling books in history, with the last one selling a record 11 million copies on the first day of its release in the UK and the US. The books have been translated into 65 languages and made her UK best-selling author with an estimated sale of £238m and more.
                                For her outstanding contribution to the literary world, she has been conferred with the prestigious Legion d'honneur by French government and Order of the British Empire.<br>

                                <b>Marie Curie:</b>
                                We have probably heard of her but it is little known that she was the first woman to win a Nobel prize. She was acknowledged with the prize for her achievements in radiation.
                                She discovered Radium and Polonium and also came up with the word radioactivity and also started working on its use to cure cancer. 
                                Marie Curie received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium, including her works on compounds and nature of radium.  And thus, he became the first person to receive two Nobel prizes.<br>
